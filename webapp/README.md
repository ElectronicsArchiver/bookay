# bookay-webapp

This is a frontend for managing your bookmarks.

# How to use

This is automatically served by the [server](../server/README.md).

Just go to your server's URL or click `Manage bookmarks` in the plugin.

## Development

`$ npm start` (server must be running for most routes to work)
`$ npm test` (but most tests are under ../test/)
