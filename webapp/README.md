# @bookay/webapp

This is a frontend for managing your bookmarks.

## How to use

This is automatically served by the [server](../server/).

Just go to your server's URL or click `Manage bookmarks` in the plugin.

## Development

This is a `create-react-app` app (though react is replaced by preact).

`$ npm start` (server must be running for most routes to work)
`$ npm test` (but most tests are under ../test/)
