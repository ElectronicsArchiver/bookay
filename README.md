# bookay

bookay is a set of free, open-source tools for self-hosting your bookmarks.

## Why?

You don't need bookay if you use the same browser everywhere, all the time.

However, if you use multiple browsers, or switch your browser from time to time, or like to access your bookmarks from elsewhere, there is currently no free service that lets you do the same things as bookay.

## Features

- easy deployment
- customizable, keyboard-friendly browser plugin
- lightweight web app
- support for nested folders
- data import and export
- scan for dupes and broken links
- support for multiple users per instance
- responsiveness and dark mode

## How to use

Host the [server](./server/README.md) somewhere - or get a tech-savvy friend to do it for you -, then simply use the browser [plugin](./plugin/README.md) and/or the [webapp](./webapp/README.md) to handle your bookmarks.
